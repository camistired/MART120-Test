        <h1>Terry the Turnip
            by Cameron Bailey
        </h1>

       <p></p>

        <p> There once was a turnip who lived with his turnip friends in a turnip village. He was the largest, grandest turnip out of all of the turnips in the village. This turnip would brag to every turnip he met about how grandiose he was.</p>
        
        <p> “I, Terry Turnip of Turnitopia, am the largest, roundest, grandest, profoundest turnip in all the land. No turnip shall ever compare to I, nor should they even try!”</p>
        
        <p> Many of the turnip villagers were uninterested in hearing about how better Terry was compared to the rest and simply wanted to live their turnip lives in peace, so they would respond very dryly and some would not even reply at all and simply waddle away from him. He did not take the hint though and continued bragging to all he met.</p>
        
        <p> “I, Terry Turnip of Turnitopia, am the largest, roundest, grandest, profoundest turnip in all the land. No turnip shall ever compare to I, nor should they even try!”</p>
        
        <p> Even his friends began to get fed up with Terry’s narcissism. Perhaps they were jealous, or perhaps they simply were tired of feeding Terry’s ego, but either way, eventually they decided to hold an intervention. It had seemed that he had grown larger with each gloat. It was getting dangerous. The larger he was, the more risk the village was at. And so, his friends each met up with him privately to try to dissuade him from growing any further.</p>
        
        <p> “Terry Turnip, my dear friend, do you not see how your boasts make the villagers feel? You are turning everyone against you, and if you continue to only talk about how great you are, then you will lose everything,” one of his friends told him.</p>
        
        <p> “I, Terry Turnip of Turnitopia, am the largest, roundest, grandest, profoundest turnip in all the land. I must make my position clear, else someone might take it from me! Surely everyone will come to understand,” Terry replied. The larger he became, the more his heart filled with paranoia that he would come to lose all he had gained, that being his roundness.</p>
        
        <p> His friend sighed heavily, “So be it. This will come back to bite you eventually, Terry.” His friend waddled away, leaving Terry by himself. Terry felt a pang in his heart, but his pride was too strong and he refused to back down now.
        
        <p> The next day, his second friend tried to appeal to him.</p>
        
        <p> “Terry Turnip, my dear friend, do you not see how large you have become? If you continue to grow at this rate, you will put everyone in danger. You must stop before it is too late,” his other friend told him.</p>
        
        <p> “I, Terry Turnip of Turnitopia, am the largest, roundest, grandest, profoundest turnip in all the land. I cannot stop now after I have come so far. Someone else could come to take my place, I must keep growing. Everyone will come to understand,” Terry replied. He had convinced himself that the only danger to the village was another turnip taking his place.</p>

        <p> His friend shrugged her shoulders, “So be it. This will come back to bite you eventually, Terry.” She waddled away, leaving Terry by himself again. He felt another pang in his heart, but his pride was too strong and he could not back down now.</p>
        
        <p> The next day, his third friend tried to plead with him.</p>
        
        <p> “Terry Turnip, my dear friend, do you not care about your friends at all? We want to help you, but we can only do so much. You have already turned down two of us, and I don’t want to have to give you up too. You must listen to us, else the consequences of your actions will become too severe,” his final friend begged.</p>
        
        <p> “I, Terry Turnip of Turnitopia, am the largest, roundest, grandest, profoundest turnip in all the land. I appreciate that you all care so much, but I know what I am doing and what I must do. If anyone were to take my place, we would all be in danger,” Terry replied. There was no way to get through to him now, he had made his position clear and there was nothing anyone could do.</p>
        
        <p> His friend looked down sadly to the ground, “So be it. This will come back to bite you soon, Terry.” He waddles away, leaving Terry by himself once more. Terry’s shoulders sagged a bit. Knowing he had lost all of his friends stung his heart, but he could not stop now. He had to maintain his position as the largest and grandest turnip there ever was. Someday everyone would come to understand.</p>
        
        <p> The next day, someone else had come to visit Terry. A farmer had been walking past his garden, taking a look at all of his vegetables when he noticed a very round turnip. “Oh boy, what a large turnip I’ve grown!” The farmer thought to himself. He plucked the turnip from the ground and took it inside, where he showed his wife, bragging about the size of the turnip he had grown. She was impressed, and decided to use it for dinner that night. She chopped the turnip up into small pieces and added them to her bowl of ingredients for her beef stew.</p>
